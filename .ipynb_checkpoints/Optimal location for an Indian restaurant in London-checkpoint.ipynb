This way, it is possible to have a taste of how the city's venues are distributed, what are the most common places for leisure, and in general, it will provide an idea of what people's likes are.\n",

The webpage is scraped using BeautifulSoup4, and the table containing Asian population of London is converted into DataFrame. The data contains information about the inmigrant population per borough and per nationality. This data will be analyzed in such a way that one could determine the best location of r anew venue/restaurant/other based on people's nationalities. For the sake of simplicity, it will be assumed for this exercise that people's likes varies according to their nationality, and that people from one specific country will be more attracted to place that matches the environment and culture of their own countries, rather than the ones from foreign countries.\n",
